# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT  
## **Meeting Emotion Analysis – General AI Emotion Analysis Platform (Bootcamp Edition)**

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### **The Big Picture**
The *Meeting Emotion Analysis* project aims to create a generalized AI-powered system capable of analyzing emotions in textual or conversational content across a wide variety of meeting contexts — from team discussions to chat transcripts. The platform will provide real-time or post-hoc "emotional intelligence analytics" to help teams identify patterns of stress, confusion, excitement, or misalignment in their communication.

### **The Problem We Solve**
Meetings and collaborative communications often suffer from hidden misalignments caused by unspoken emotions — stress, skepticism, frustration, or confusion. These emotions, if left undetected, derail project progress, especially in fast-paced AI teams or technical bootcamps. This system detects emotional cues from text or conversation data to provide actionable insights that improve team harmony and project execution.

### **Our Target User**
* Teams involved in high-stakes discussions (AI product development, education cohorts, and general business teams).
* Product managers, educators, or facilitators who aim to measure emotional engagement and identify friction points in team interactions.

### **Core Capabilities (MVP)**
- Emotion detection from text (via input log or transcript)
- Summary dashboard showing emotion distribution
- Highlight of “emotional spikes” across key conversation segments

### **Complexity Snapshot**
- **Architectural Complexity:** Moderate (Model inference and data pipeline)
- **External Service Integrations:** None in MVP (optional APIs deferred)
- **Business Logic Depth:** Simple interpretation and aggregation logic

### **MVP Success Criteria**
- [ ] The system can process a meeting transcript and return emotion scores (joy, frustration, anxiety, confusion, neutrality).
- [ ] Results are presented in a clear summary format (JSON or dashboard view).
- [ ] Users can view emotion trends per speaker or per topic for a single meeting.

## **3. USER WORKFLOWS**

### **3.1 Critical Path — Analyze Meeting Emotion**
1. Jordan logs in.
2. Uploads a meeting transcript file.
3. System runs emotion classification.
4. Dashboard displays emotion distribution and high-intensity spikes.
5. Jordan exports the report to share with her team.

### **3.2 Alternate Path: View Historical Analyses**
1. Jordan opens the dashboard.
2. Selects any past meeting analysis from a list.
3. Views emotion summaries and compares across dates.

---

## **4. BUSINESS RULES**

- Only authenticated users can analyze or store data.
- Uploaded text data is stored temporarily for processing (MVP retention: 30 days).
- Maximum transcript size per analysis: 20,000 words.
- Supported languages: English for MVP; multilingual deferred.

---

## **5. DATA REQUIREMENTS**

### **8.1 In Scope for MVP**
- FR-001 Emotion Analysis Processor  
- FR-002 Emotion Summary Dashboard  
- FR-003 Report Export  
- FR-101 Account Management

### **8.2 Deferred Features**
| Deferred Feature | Description | Rationale |
|------------------|--------------|------------|
| **DF-001**: Real-Time Speech-to-Emotion analysis | Analyze audio/video inputs live. | High engineering complexity; requires real-time streaming. |
| **DF-002**: Multilingual Emotion Detection | Support for non-English languages. | Adds linguistic model complexity; not core to MVP validation. |
| **DF-003**: Collaborative Annotation & Feedback | Allow multiple users to label and correct emotions. | Non-essential for first sprint; valuable in V2 for model training. |
| **DF-004**: Automated Meeting Summarization | Generate meeting summaries with emotionally weighted key sentences. | Compound feature on top of emotion recognition; defer to later versions. |

---

## **9. ASSUMPTIONS & DECISIONS**

- MVP assumes all meeting data is provided as textual input.
- Model training and improvements will be post-MVP.
- No integration with third-party video or conferencing tools for V1.
- Users prioritize insight from emotion trends over live interactivity.

---

## **10. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS**

### **Performance**
